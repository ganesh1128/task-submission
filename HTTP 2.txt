HTTP 1.1
 Persistent conection means that a single tcp connection can used for multiple http requests(6connections).
 It process one request process at a time through tcp connection.
 TCP connetion gets blocked till the response is received.
 The tcp connction established between client and server are limited.
 Low latency which describes a computer network that is optimized to process a very high volume of data messages with minimal delay.
 HOL-head of line blocking. 
 Header information repeated with every request.
 TCP Keepalive Packets can be used to determine if the connection is still valid, and terminate it if needed.
 Keep-alive option enables re-using of the same tcp connection to multiple http reqests.

HTTP 2
 It makes web more secure.
 One secured tcp connection is setup in which http requests are transformed in the form of streams.
 It allows (multiplexing) it means the browser can request and receive many different files at the same time 
 It solve the head-of-line blocking problem.
 HPACK header data is separated from the request data and can be zipped.Headers are compressed.
 HPACK also enables reuse of header data which is repeated in every request.It reduces the request size.
 Doest wait for one file to finish before starting the dowload of next one.
 Binary protocals consume less bandwidth are more efficiently parsed and less error prone compared to http 1.1.
 Server Push likely to be used resources into a browserâ€™s cache, even before they are requested.
 Push frames used carfully as this can lead to increase the size of the http response.
